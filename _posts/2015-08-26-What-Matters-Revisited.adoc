= What Matters, Revisited

Approximately one and a half years ago, I was asked (via college application, no less) an interesting question. "What matters most to you, and why? (250 words)" 

Being the creative little shit that I was (and still am), I wrote a cute little essay about daydreaming. I wrote it because it made for an interesting essay, but little did I know how __right__ I was. At the time, I figured that my "real" answer to the question would be something along the lines of "friendship" or "happiness" or some other vague, wishy-washy buzzword. Now I realize that I was on to something in that essay, something worth revisiting. Daydreams are fucking important, and here's why.
