= Define Extrapolate

Extrapolate is a blog.

Not a travel blog, or a food blog, or a book/movie review blog, though these are all things that I enjoy and will likely find themselves cameos in posts here and there. Extrapolate isn't a daily/weekly/{insert regular time interval}-ly journal blog either, though it might seem like it at times. 

Extrapolate is an ongoing record of the more interesting "ideas" that find their ways into my mind. I hesitate to use the word "ideas" here because (at least in my personal connotation-dictionary) __ideas__ are discrete, and useful in some compacity. The processes that I spend most of my mental CPU on are neither of these.
