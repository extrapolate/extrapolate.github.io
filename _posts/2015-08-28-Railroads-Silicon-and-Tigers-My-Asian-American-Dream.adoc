= Railroads, Silicon, and Tigers: My Asian American Dream

__Disclaimer: This essay is based entirely on personal experience and observations. I realize that I come from a place of privelege, and that my story hardly applies to all Asian Americans. But I'm not here to write universal truths. I'm here to write about me.__

I am priveleged, but I am not white. 

My story is neither universal nor unique. My story is neither inspirational nor tragic. And it sure as hell isn't simple. 

First, a little about myself. I am 18. I was born and raised in Silicon Valley suburbia. Affluent and predominantly white, but with a sizable Asian population.
