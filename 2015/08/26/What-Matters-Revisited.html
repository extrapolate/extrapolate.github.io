<p>Approximately one and a half years ago, I was asked (via college application, no less) an interesting question. "What matters most to you, and why? (250 words)"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being the creative little shit that I was (and still am), I wrote a cute little essay about daydreaming. I wrote it because it made for an interesting essay, but little did I know how <em>right</em> I was. At the time, I figured that my "real" answer to the question would be something along the lines of "friendship" or "happiness" or some other vague, wishy-washy buzzword. Now I realize that I was on to something in that essay. Daydreams <em>are</em> fucking important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As backwards as it may sound, it&#8217;s only when I&#8217;m daydreaming that I feel <strong>lucid</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here I use daydreaming not in the falling-asleep-during-boring-lecture sense, or the fuck-that-girl-is-so-cute-I-wish-I-had-the-balls-to-ask-her-out sense. I think of daydreaming as more of a method of thought, or a state of mind. Kind of like an undirected form of introspection. I think it might be easier to first explain what daydreaming <em>isn&#8217;t</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By virtue of being a typical member of society, you&#8217;re kind of guaranteed to have some sort of rhythm to your day/week/year/life. Whether it&#8217;s a class schedule or a nine-to-five, there is a pattern, a sequence of motions you go through with some degree of regularity. After a few repetitions, it becomes muscle memory, autopilot. We&#8217;re always so <em>busy</em> that it becomes necessary for the sake of survival to sort of just sleepwalk through our days and weeks. It&#8217;s efficient, it conserves energy. But it feels shitty. Not the blatant shittiness of stress or exhaustion, but a hollow shittiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s like being a sheep, being jostled and shuffled along by the fluffy, amorphous mass of your equally unconscious fellow sheep. You keep sleep/sheepwalking ever onwards because it&#8217;s easy and you don&#8217;t want to be left behind. Granted, it doesn&#8217;t always look like this. I should clarify that this notion of consciousness has nothing to do with ambition or intelligence. You can be incredibly smart and driven and hard-working, but it doesn&#8217;t matter if you just happen to be in a herd of particularly intelligent/fast/industrious sheep. You miss out on a whole lot by only looking forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spend most of my waking hours in this semi-shitty, sheep-like state. I go through the motions. I apply my intellect outwardly, on whatever assignment or concept I find in front of me, but I don&#8217;t <em>think</em> about what I&#8217;m doing. I interact with friends and family, I laugh and I argue, but all of it feels involuntary. Knee-jerk. It&#8217;s disturbingly easy to forget your own sentience and free will.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In comparison to this state of non-REM, comatose, mental deadness, daydreaming feels refreshingly lucid. To continue the sheep analogy, daydreaming is like taking a moment to remind yourself where you are, where you&#8217;re going. To figure out where you want to be, and where you want to be going. To ask the important questions: who/what is shepherding us in this general direction, and why? Or are we part of some organic, self-propagating system that shuffles ever-closer to cliff&#8217;s edge by random chance and game theory? To daydream is to simulate the various "what if"s and "if only"s to see if we&#8217;d be better off heading down some other path. To daydream is to ask yourself what matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And these questions <em>are</em> important. After all, how are you going to find happiness if you don&#8217;t know what it looks like? If you don&#8217;t know what matters, nothing really matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it until now, but I started this blog in search of this type of lucidity. I like to write for the same reason that I like to travel and go on spontaneous late-night adventures: to interrupt whatever rhythm I&#8217;ve fallen into and temporarily reset my lucidity. So yes, daydreams matter. Stay lucid, friends.</p>
