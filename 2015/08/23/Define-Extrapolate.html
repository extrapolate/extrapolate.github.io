            <div class="paragraph">
<p>Extrapolate is a blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not a travel blog, or a food blog, or a book/movie review blog, though these are all things that I enjoy and will likely pop up in posts here and there. Extrapolate isn&#8217;t a daily/weekly/{insert regular time interval}-ly journal blog either, though it might seem like it at times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Extrapolate is an ongoing record of the more interesting "ideas" that find their ways into my mind. I hesitate to use the word "ideas" here because (at least in my personal connotation-dictionary) <em>ideas</em> are discrete, and useful in some compacity. The things I think about are hardly discrete and rarely useful, instead occupying the hazy intellectual territory at the intersection of personal experience and pattern recognition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That last bit probably makes zero sense to you, so let me try to explain. As I go about my exceptionally average life, I (like my 7+ billion fellow humans) naturally accumulate a set of experiences, memories, ideas. <em>These</em> are discrete; I can mentally point to a conversation I&#8217;ve had, or an article I&#8217;ve read, or a place I&#8217;ve been to. In isolation, these "points" are hardly worth thinking about, much less writing about. If I led a more interesting life, I could&#8217;ve made this blog a place to simply <code>Ctrl+C</code> <code>Ctrl+V</code> these experiences/ideas from my sensory receptors, with a dash of introspection. The analytical analog of an Instagram filter, basically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But for better or worse, my life <em>is</em> pretty mundane, so I spend a lot of my time daydreaming, iterating through all possible interpretations of these ordinary experiences in their infinite permutations. I draw parallels between distinct points based on tenuous similarities, then substantiate them with further observation. I find/create metaphors and symbols in daily life where they previously didn&#8217;t exist. I try to find a theory, a common thread, a line of best fit to interpolate and provide meaning to the points I&#8217;ve accumulated thus far. And as the name of the blog might suggest, I like to extend these narratives to areas that I am highly underqualified to talk about, including my own future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So take these posts with a grain of salt each. Each line of best fit has an R^2 value, and sometimes even I don&#8217;t entirely subscribe to the ideas I come up with. I don&#8217;t write these ideas down with the intention of convincing anyone. I write in the hopes that someone might identify with me; I write so that I don&#8217;t forget; I write for the sake of writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, the use of all this first-person might have got you wondering, who am I? I&#8217;ll inevitably disclose some details about me in later posts, but I want to keep my identity more or less secret for now. I want to avoid judgment and commitment as much as possible. I want to keep this blog simple, unadulterated, and occasionally vulgar and/or controversial. I don&#8217;t even know how long this thing is going to last, if I&#8217;m going to run out of motivation or ideas or time or whatever. You, reader, can help me out on this front by giving me things to write about <a href="http://ask.fm/xtrapolate">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wow, this inaugural post got long/heavy/pretentious real quick. Evidently, I need to chill the fuck out. Until then, good night.</p>
